# Overview:

My shell operates by taking the command line and tokenizes it based off of the
semicolons to get a list of commands. That list is then passed to a function that
takes each command and tokenizes it by whitespace to pass the command to the
execution function. It does this for each command one at a time until it reaches
the end of the command list. For batch files, the file is read line by line and
each line is passed to the same parsing and execution functions that are used for
the interactive command line operation. This process is executed in a while loop
that runs until the quit command is received.

# Specification:

For lines that have no commands between semicolons, the extra whitespace is ignored.
I have a function that explicitely checks for whitespace, and if the token is only
whitespace, then it is discarded and a new token is found.
The shell treats multiple semicolons in a row as if they were one semicolon. It also
ignores semicolons that are in front of commands (ie. ";; ls -l" is treated as if it
were "ls -l"). 
For the execution of processes, there is one loop that forks and executes the commands,
and another loop that ensures that the parent process waits for each of the children.
